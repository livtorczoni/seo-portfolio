				<h3>The Challenge</h3>
				<p>Austin Bouldering Project is an all-in-one co-working space, bouldering gym, yoga studio, and fitness center in Austin, Texas. Members of ABP are able to edit and modify their accounts using the ABP website, however, <strong>prior to this project, members were experiencing friction when trying to access and edit their accounts on the website.</strong></p>

				<p>A button labeled ‚ÄòMy Account‚Äô was placed in a side panel (pictured below), which was difficult to find, lacking any affordances as to who the button was for and where the button would take the user after clicking. So, I got high-level support and <strong>set out on a journey to redesign the online membership feature using a user-centered design process.</strong></p>

					<h3>Testing The Feature</h3>
					<p class="challenge">Usability Testing</p>

					<p>To test the ‚ÄòMy Account‚Äô button, I began by conducting usability tests with current and new members, prescribing various tasks to measure task-success rates. I also chose to utilize the Litger scale as a way to measure user satisfaction after completion of a task. This entailed asking each participant to rate the completed task on a scale from 1-5, with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult.</p>

					<p><strong>In total, I facilitated 8 usability tests.</strong> As hypothesized, even with the ‚ÄòMy Account‚Äô button on every single page of the website, it went unnoticed by every user.</p>

					<p>The usability tests allowed me to see how users find information, which navigation components are utilized, which ones go unnoticed, and which ones are avoided. Utilizing the Litger Scale also provided me with additional qualitative data into how users felt about the tasks overall.</p>

					<p>20% of users were able to find the ‚ÄòMy Account‚Äô button, however, each user took longer than 30 seconds and needed more than 3 clicks to find it.</p>

				<div id="insight-bg">
					<h3>üßê</h3> 
					<p>To my surprise, I discovered the task-success rate did not correlate with the user‚Äôs Litger rating. Several participants rated a task with a 1 or 2 (very easy) even though they were unable to complete the task and/or verbally grieved about a component on the interface.</p>

					<p><strong>Next, I tested the information architecture (IA) with an open card sort.</strong> I wanted to understand and measure how the user would expect to see the navigation organized on the Austin Bouldering Project website.</p>

						<h3>üßê</h3>
						<p class="f-drk-prpl">The navigation labels on the site, for the most part, were understandable to recurring members, however, some labels suprised us and weren‚Äôt intuitive at all. For instance ‚û°Ô∏è</p>

			<div class="img-below-container">
				<h3 style="padding-top: 4rem;">Competitive Analysis</h3>

				<p>Next, I performed a light competitive analysis to discover any opportunities we might have to create a more intuitive and delightful user experience. Instead of just creating a checklist of comparative features, I assessed our competitors (in co-working & fitness center spaces) based on common user scenarios: <strong>Search, Edit Account, and Submit Change.</strong></p>

				<img src="images/abp/competitive-analysis.png" alt="image of competitive analysis between ABP and other gyms">
			</div>

			<div class="basic-container">
				<p>It turned out that we actually had a lot of the core features our competition had. However, there was still a <strong>massive opportunity to be had in the design and development of those items and functionalities.</strong> Armed with inspiration from the competitive analysis, I embarked on some high-level brainstorming of core issues in the flow.</p>

				<h3 style="padding-top: 2rem;">Ideation</h3>

				<p>After presenting my research findings from the usability tests, card sort, and competitive analysis, I convinced my stakeholders to perform a couple round of crazy 8's with my team.</p><br>

				<p>We iterated on our best ideas by sketching them out on white-boards. Because of this small ideation session, <strong>I was able to quickly develop the first user flows without touching a single pixle.</strong></p>

					<h3>Wireframing & Testing</h3>

					<p>After ideation, I began to build my first digital prototype. I conducted multiple, small usability tests to see how my designs performed with users.</p>

				<div>
					<h5 class="f-blu">My focus was on:</h5>

					<p><strong>Browsing:</strong> updates to the landing page and navigation</p>

					<p><strong>The "My Account" button:</strong> rework the visual design and include sign-posts to increase learnability and memorability</p>

				<h3>Detailed Design</h3>

				<p>My usability tests prompted me to nix the ‚ÄòMy Account‚Äô button and remove the sticky side panel altogether. With the card-sort data, I revised some of the navigation titles and changed the hierarchy based on business goals.</p>

			</div>

			<div class="sptlght-box-700-grn" style="margin-bottom: 9rem;">
				<h3 class="f-drk-grn">Impact</h3>
				
				<p>Comparing the task-success rates from the original design to my designs, the results showed an <strong>increase of 80% in the discoverability of the ‚ÄòMy Account‚Äô button, with a 15 second and 2-click target goal.</strong></p>

			<h2 class="section-title">The Wrap Up</h2>

			<div class="basic-container">
				<h3>Learnings & Reflections...</h3>
				<p>In testing, I repeatedly received feedback from participants that they were trying to follow what they had seen on other websites, which goes to show <strong>mental models are formed through frequent use of a system</strong> and the understanding of how it works. Additionally, my user-centered design process helped the stakeholders understand the importance of user research. I was able to demonstrate the power of small design tweaks, and how drastically they change a digital experience.</p>
